Reinforcement Learning Examples
===============================

Single-gpu training reinforcement learning examples can be launched from
`isaacgymenvs` with `python train.py`.

When training with the viewer (not headless), you can press `v` to toggle
viewer sync. Disabling viewer sync will improve performance, especially
in GPU pipeline mode. Viewer sync can be re-enabled at any time to check
training progress.

List of Examples
----------------

### Ant [ant.py](../isaacgymenvs/tasks/ant.py)

An example of a simple locomotion task, the goal is to train quadruped
robots (ants) to run forward as fast as possible. The Ant task includes
examples of utilizing Isaac Gym's actor root state tensor, DOF state
tensor, and force sensor tensor APIs. Actor root states provide data for
the ant's root body, including position, rotation, linear and angular
velocities. This information can be used to detect whether the ant has
been moving towards the desired direction and whether it has fallen or
flipped over. DOF states are used to retrieve the position and velocity
of each DOF for the ant, and force sensors are used to indicate contacts
with the ground plane on the ant's legs.

Actions are applied onto the DOFs of the ants to allow it to move, using
the `set_dof_actuation_force_tensor` API.

During resets, we also show usage of
`set_actor_root_state_tensor_indexed` and `set_dof_state_tensor_indexed`
APIs for setting select ants into a valid starting state.

It can be launched with command line argument `task=Ant`.

Config files used for this task are:

-   **Task config**: [Ant.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/task/Ant.yaml)
-   **rl_games training config**: [AntPPO.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/train/AntPPO.yaml)

### Humanoid [humanoid.py](../isaacgymenvs/tasks/humanoid.py)

The humanoid example is conceptually very similar to the Ant task. In
this example, we also use actor root states to detect whether humanoids
are been moving towards the desired direction and whether they have
fallen. DOF states are used to retrieve the position and velocity of
each DOF for the humanoids, and force sensors are used to indicate
contacts with the ground plane on the humanoids' feet.

It can be launched with command line argument `task=Humanoid`.

Config files used for this task are:

-   **Task config**: [Humanoid.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/task/Humanoid.yaml)
-   **rl_games training config**: [HumanoidPPO.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/train/HumanoidPPO.yaml)

### Shadow Hand Object Manipulation [shadow_hand.py](../isaacgymenvs/tasks/shadow_hand.py)

The Shadow Hand task is an example of a challenging dexterity
manipulation task with complex contact dynamics. It resembles OpenAI's
[Learning Dexterity](https://openai.com/blog/learning-dexterity/)
project and [Robotics Shadow
Hand](https://github.com/openai/gym/tree/master/gym/envs/robotics)
training environments. It also demonstrates the use of tendons in the
Shadow Hand model. In this example, we use `get_asset_tendon_properties`
and `set_asset_tendon_properties` to get and set tendon properties for
the hand. Motion of the hand is controlled using position targets with
`set_dof_position_target_tensor`.

The goal is to orient the object in the hand to match the target
orientation. There is a goal object that shows the target orientation to
be achieved by the manipulated object. To reset both the target object
and the object in hand, it is important to make **one** single call to
`set_actor_root_state_tensor_indexed` to set the states for both
objects. This task has 3 difficulty levels using different objects to
manipulate - block, egg and pen and different observations schemes -
`openai`, `full_no_vel`, `full` and `full_state` that can be set in the
task config in `observationType` field. Moreover it supports asymmetric
observations, when policy and value functions get different sets of
observation.

The basic version of the task can be launched with command line argument `task=ShadowHand`.

Config files used for this task are:

-   **Task config**: [ShadowHand.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/task/ShadowHand.yaml)
-   **rl_games training config**: [ShadowHandPPO.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/train/ShadowHandPPO.yaml)

Observations types:

-   **openai**: fingertip positions, object position and relative to the
    goal object orientation. These are the same set of observations as used in
    the OpenAI [Learning Dexterity](https://openai.com/blog/learning-dexterity/) project
-   **full_no_vel**: the same as `full` but without any velocity
    information for joints, object and fingertips
-   **full**: a standard set of observations with joint positions and
    velocities, object pose, linear and angular velocities, the goal
    pose and fingertip transforms, and their linear and angular
    velocities
-   **full_state**: `full` set of observations plus readings from
    force-torque sensors attached to the fingertips and joint forces
    sensors. This is the default used by the base **ShadowHand** task

#### OpenAI Variant

In addition to the basic version of this task, there is an additional variant matching OpenAI's [Learning Dexterity](https://openai.com/blog/learning-dexterity/) project.
This variant uses the **openai** observations in the policy network, but asymmetric observations of the **full_state** in the value network.
This can be launched with command line argument `task=ShadowHandOpenAI_FF`.

Config files used for this are:

-   **Task config**: [ShadowHandOpenAI_FF.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/task/ShadowHandOpenAI_FF.yaml)
-   **rl_games training config**: [ShadowHandOpenAI_FFPPO.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/train/ShadowHandOpenAI_FFPPO.yaml).

![Shadow_Hand_OpenAI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/463063/125262637-328e2100-e2b7-11eb-99af-ea546a53f66a.gif)

#### LSTM Training Variants

There are two other variants of training 

-   [ShadowHandOpenAI_LSTM](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/train/ShadowHandOpenAI_LSTMPPO.yaml)
    -   This variant uses LSTM policy and value networks instead of
        feed forward networks, and also asymmetric LSTM critic designed for the OpenAI variant of the task.
    - This can be launched with command line argument `task=ShadowHandOpenAI_LSTM`.
-   [ShadowHand_LSTM](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/train/ShadowHandPPOLSTM.yaml)
    -   This variant uses LSTM policy and value networks instead of
        feed forward networks, but unlike the previous config, uses symmetric observations for the standard variant of Shadow Hand.
    - This can be launched with command line argument `task=ShadowHand train=ShadowHandPPOLSTM`.

#### OpenAI Testing Variant

This is a testing variant of the config to match test conditions from the Learning Dexterity paper such as a longer episode time and not re-applying 
domain randomizations after initial randomization. It is not intended to be used for training. Note that if the successTolerance config option is changed to 0.1 during training,
running the testing variant with the standard 0.4 successTolerance will show improved performance. The testing variant will also output the average number of 
consecutive successes to the console, showing both the direct average of all environments as well as the average only over environments that have finished.
Over time these numbers should converge. 

To test the FF OpenAI variant, use these arguments: `task=ShadowHandTest train=ShadowHandOpenAI_FFPPO test=True checkpoint=<CHECKPOINT_TO_LOAD>`.

To test the LSTM OpenAI variant, use these arguments: `task=ShadowHandTest train=ShadowHandOpenAI_LSTMPPO test=True checkpoint=<CHECKPOINT_TO_LOAD>`.

-   **Task config**: [ShadowHandOpenTest.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/task/ShadowHandTest.yaml)


### Allegro Hand [allegro_hand.py](../isaacgymenvs/tasks/allegro_hand.py)

This example performs the same cube manipulation task as the Shadow Hand environment, but using the Allegro hand instead of the Shadow hand.

It can be launched with command line argument `task=AllegroHand`.

Config files used for this task are:

-   **Task config**: [AllegroHand.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/task/AllegroHand.yaml)
-   **rl_games training config**: [AllegroHandPPO.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/train/AllegroHandPPO.yaml)

![Allegro_Hand_400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/463063/125261559-38373700-e2b6-11eb-80eb-b250a0693f0b.gif)


### Anymal [anymal.py](../isaacgymenvs/tasks/anymal.py)

This example trains a model of the ANYmal quadruped robot from ANYbotics
to follow randomly chosen x, y, and yaw target velocities.

It can be launched with command line argument `task=Anymal`.

Config files used for this task are:

-   **Task config**: [Anymal.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/task/Anymal.yaml)
-   **rl_games training config**: [AnymalPPO.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/train/AnymalPPO.yaml)

![image](images/rl_anymal.png)

### Anymal Rough Terrain [anymal_terrain.py](../isaacgymenvs/tasks/anymal_terrain.py)

A highly upgraded version of the original Anymal environment which supports
traversing rough terrain and sim2real.

It can be launched with command line argument `task=AnymalTerrain`.

-   **Task config**: [AnymalTerrain.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/task/AnymalTerrain.yaml)
-   **rl_games training config**: [AnymalTerrainPPO.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/train/AnymalTerrainPPO.yaml)

**Note** during test time use the last weights generated, rather than the usual best weights. 
Due to curriculum training, the reward goes down as the task gets more challenging, so the best weights
do not typically correspond to the best outcome.

**Note** if you use the ANYmal rough terrain environment in your work, please ensure you cite the following work:

**Note** The IsaacGymEnvs implementation slightly differs from the implementation used in the paper above, which also
uses a different RL library and PPO implementation. The original implementation will be made available [here](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym). Results reported in the Isaac Gym technical paper are based on that repository, not this one.

### Trifinger [trifinger.py](../isaacgymenvs/tasks/trifinger.py)

The [Trifinger](isaacgymenvs/tasks/trifinger.py) environment is modelled on the [Real Robot Challenge 2020](https://real-robot-challenge.com/2020).
The goal is to move the cube to the desired target location, which is represented by a superimposed cube.

It can be launched with command line argument `task=Trifinger`.

### NASA Ingenuity Helicopter [ingenuity.py](../isaacgymenvs/tasks/ingenuity.py)

This example trains a simplified model of NASA's Ingenuity helicopter to navigate to a moving target.
It showcases the use of velocity tensors and applying force vectors to rigid bodies.
Note that we are applying force directly to the chassis, rather than simulating aerodynamics.
This example also demonstrates using different values for gravitational forces, as well as dynamically writing a physics model from Python code at runtime.

It can be launched with command line argument `task=Ingenuity`.

Config files used for this task are:

-   **Task config**: [Ingenuity.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/task/Ingenuity.yaml)
-   **rl_games training config**: [IngenuityPPO.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/train/IngenuityPPO.yaml)

### Cartpole [cartpole.py](../isaacgymenvs/tasks/cartpole.py)

Cartpole is a simple example that shows usage of the DOF state tensors. Position and velocity data are used as observation for the cart and pole DOFs. Actions are applied as forces to the cart using `set_dof_actuation_force_tensor`. During reset, we use `set_dof_state_tensor_indexed` to set DOF position and velocity of the cart and pole to a randomized state.

It can be launched with command line argument `task=Cartpole`.

Config files used for this task are:

-   **Task config**: [Cartpole.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/task/Cartpole.yaml)
-   **rl_games training config**: [CartpolePPO.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/train/CartpolePPO.yaml)

### Ball Balance [ball_balance.py](../isaacgymenvs/tasks/ball_balance.py)

This example trains balancing tables to balance a ball on the table top.
This is a great example to showcase the use of force and torque sensors, as well as DOF states for the table and root states for the ball. In this example, the three-legged table has a force sensor attached to each leg using the `create_force_sensor` API. We use the force sensor tensor APIs to collect force and torque data on the legs, which guide position target outputs produced by the policy. The example shows usage of `set_dof_position_target_tensor` to set position targets to keep the ball balanced on the table.

It can be launched with command line argument `task=BallBalance`.

Config files used for this task are:

-   **Task config**: [BallBalance.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/task/BallBalance.yaml)
-   **rl_games training config**: [BallBalancePPO.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/train/BallBalancePPO.yaml)

![image](images/rl_ballbalance.png)

### Franka Cabinet [franka_cabinet.py](../isaacgymenvs/tasks/franka_cabinet.py)

The Franka example demonstrates interaction between Franka arm and cabinet, as well as setting states of objects inside the drawer.
It also showcases control of the Franka arm using position targets.
In this example, we use DOF state tensors to retrieve the state of the Franka arm, as well as the state of the drawer on the cabinet.
Actions are applied using `set_dof_position_target_tensor` to set position targets for the Franka arm DOFs.

During reset, we use indexed versions of APIs to reset Franka, cabinet, and objects inside drawer to their initial states. `set_actor_root_state_tensor_indexed` is used to reset objects inside drawer, `set_dof_position_target_tensor_indexed` is used to reset Franka, and `set_dof_state_tensor_indexed` is used to reset Franka and cabinet.

It can be launched with command line argument `task=FrankaCabinet`.

Config files used for this task are:

-   **Task config**: [FrankaCabinet.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/task/FrankaCabinet.yaml)
-   **rl_games training config**: [FrankaCabinetPPO.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/train/FrankaCabinetPPO.yaml)

### Quadcopter [quadcopter.py](../isaacgymenvs/tasks/quadcopter.py)

This example trains a very simple quadcopter model to reach and hover near a fixed position.  The quadcopter model is generated procedurally and doesn't actually include any rotating blades.  Lift is achieved by applying thrust forces to the "rotor" bodies, which are modeled as flat cylinders.  This is a good example of using LOCAL_SPACE forces.  In addition to thrust, the pitch and roll of each rotor is controlled using DOF position targets.

It can be launched with command line argument `task=Quadcopter`.

Config files used for this task are:

-   **Task config**: [Quadcopter.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/task/Quadcopter.yaml)
-   **rl_games training config**: [QuadcopterPPO.yaml](../isaacgymenvs/cfg/train/QuadcopterPPO.yaml)
